## Background

4,000 projects will be examined to determine the success strategies and key trends to scure funding from Kickstarter, a highly successful crowdfunding service donor.

## Requirements

1. Number of campaigns that are successful, failed, cancel, and live by category where the user can filter by country using a stacked bar graph.
2. Number of campaigns that are successful, failed, cancel, and live by sub-category where the user can filter by parent-category and country using a stacked bar graph.
3. Number of campaigns that are successful, failed, cancel, and live by month where the user can filter by parent-category and year using a line graph.
4. Number and % of campaigns that are successful, failed, cancel, and live by funding goals summarizing in a table.
5. Determine the mean, median, minimum value, maximum value, variance (population & sample) and standard deviation (population & sample) for the backers count in successful and failed campaigns.

## Method 

An excel file has been provided with the details of the 4,000 projects to conduct the following analysis:

**Worksheet Tab (Given)**
* Define the campaign status in the "state" column with conditional formatting. 
* Create a new column Percent Funded to calculate the Percent(%) Fundedd for each project and use conditional formatting using a 3-color scale.
* Create a new column Average Donation that uses a formula to uncover how much each backer for the project paid on average.
* Create two new columns, Category andSub-Category, which use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into two parts.

**Pivot Table & Stacked Bar Chart for Campaign Statuses**
