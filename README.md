## Background

## Requirements

An excel file has been provided with the details of the 4,000 projects to conduct the following analysis:

* Define the campaign status in the "state" column with conditional formatting using different colors for different statuses. 
  * successful = green
  * failed = red
  * canceled = orange
  * live = blue
* Create a new column Percent Funded to calculate the Percent(%) Fundedd for each project.
* After completing the calculation on the Percent Funded column, use conditional formatting using a three-color scale.
