## Background

4,000 projects will be examined to determine the success strategies and key trends to scure funding from Kickstarter, a highly successful crowdfunding service donor.

## Requirements

An excel file has been provided with the details of the 4,000 projects to conduct the following analysis:

* Define the campaign status in the "state" column with conditional formatting using different colors for different statuses. 
  * successful = <span style="color: green"> green </span>
  * failed = <span style="color: red"> red </span>
  * canceled = <span style="color: orange"> orange </span>
  * live = <span style="color: blue"> blue </span>
* Create a new column Percent Funded to calculate the Percent(%) Fundedd for each project.
* After completing the calculation on the Percent Funded column, use conditional formatting using a three-color scale.
