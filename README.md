## Requirements

An excel file has been provided with the details of the 4,000 projects to conduct the following analysis:

**Worksheet Tab (Given)**
* Define the campaign status in the "state" column with conditional formatting using different colors for different statuses. 
* Create a new column Percent Funded to calculate the Percent(%) Fundedd for each project.
* After completing the calculation on the Percent Funded column, use conditional formatting using a three-color scale.
* Create a new column Average Donation that uses a formula to uncover how much each backer for the project paid on average.
* Create two new columns, Category andSub-Category, which use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into two parts.

**Pivot Table & Stacked Bar Chart for Campaign Statuses*
